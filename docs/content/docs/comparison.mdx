Here are non detailed reasons why you may want to use Better Auth over other auth libraries and services.

### vs Other Auth Libraries

- **Framework agnostic** - Works with any framework, not just specific ones
- **Advanced features built-in** - 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session, rate limiting, and many more
- **Plugin system** - Extend functionality without forking or complex workarounds
- **Full control** - Customize auth flows exactly how you want
- **Flexible deployment** - Run alongside your app or as a standalone self-hosted auth server

### vs Managed Auth Services

- **Keep your data** - Users stay in your database, not a third-party service
- **No per-user costs** - Scale without worrying about auth billing
- **Single source of truth** - All user data in one place
- **Self-host anywhere** - Deploy on your own infrastructure with full control

### vs Rolling Your Own

- **Security handled** - Battle-tested auth flows and security practices
- **Focus on your product** - Spend time on features that matter to your business
- **Plugin extensibility** - Add custom features without starting from scratch
- **Production ready** - Works embedded in your app or as a dedicated auth server
